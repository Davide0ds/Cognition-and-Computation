# Cognition-and-Computation

## Project Topic:

The objective of this project is to implement simulations to explore computational models of visual concept learning, specifically focusing on unsupervised learning in generative models using a Deep Belief Network (DBN). We aim to make sense of the representations learned by the DBN through visualization techniques such as analyzing receptive fields and clustering representation.

To further evaluate the performance of the DBN, we will incorporate a Linear-ReadOut (LRO) and compare it with a Feed Forward Neural Network. By adding the LRO, we can assess how well the DBN's representations can be utilized for classification tasks. Additionally, we will probe both models by injecting noisy data to understand their robustness to sensory perturbations and make a comparative analysis.

Furthermore, we will explore the models' responses and resilience to adversarial attacks, examining their vulnerabilities and behavior in the face of perturbations aimed at deceiving them.
